* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/industrial-electrical-drives-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Introduction to Ladder Logic/Introduction to Ladder Logic_01_Usability_smk.org][Introduction to Ladder Logic_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the condition links in the NOR Logic presentation

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on the conditional links, the result of the selected condition should be displayed on the screen
